Hello, I'm Andreas and I hail from the picturesque region of Bavaria, Germany. Professionally, I wear multiple hats, working at the intersection of IT and Sales. My career is a blend of technical expertise and a knack for building meaningful relationships with clients.

One of my passions outside of work is tinkering with cutting-edge technology. You'll often find me immersed in projects involving ESP32, ESP8266, and Raspberry Pi. These devices allow me to explore the fascinating world of IoT and automation, turning ideas into tangible, functional systems.

But my journey doesn't stop there. I'm committed to continuous self-improvement, especially in the realm of programming. The art of coding is a puzzle I enjoy solving daily, and I'm on a quest to become a better programmer with each line of code I write.

At home, I've transformed my living space into a smart haven using Home Assistant. It's where my passion for technology and automation truly shines. I believe in the power of a smart home to enhance convenience and efficiency, and I'm always eager to share my experiences and insights in this field.

This About Me page is a glimpse into my multifaceted worldâ€”where Bavarian charm meets the ever-evolving landscape of IT, where creativity and technology collide. Join me on this exciting journey as I continue to explore, learn, and innovate.

Thank you for visiting, and feel free to connect with me. I'm always up for a good tech conversation or collaboration.
